Hello everyone,

I created a construction site on the bridge west of Alamo Lake, also known as the "Calafia Bridge". The construction site is deliberately kept small, but tight spaces are intended to provide variety with scaffolding and a crane. As usual, the NPCs cleverly avoid the construction site. The passage is particularly tricky due to the closure and the cramped conditions with the scaffolding and the crane. These factors also provide an ideal playground for Crimlers to plan tactical maneuvers and set clever ambushes.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. If you have any suggestions or feedback, you can simply contact me via direct message.
